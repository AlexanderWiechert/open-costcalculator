You are maintaining an open-source Python CLI project hosted on GitHub. You want to encourage contributions and help new developers quickly understand how to participate.

Your project uses:

- GitHub for hosting, pull requests and issues
- `src/` layout with modular code
- `pytest`, `flake8`, and `black` for code quality
- A `Makefile` to standardize common development tasks

Steps:

1. Create a file named `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root of the project
2. Describe the development setup process (clone, virtualenv, install requirements)
3. Document how to run tests and linting (`make test`, `make lint`)
4. Explain how to add a new resource analyzer module (if relevant)
5. Outline pull request guidelines (formatting, test coverage, commit style)
6. Optionally include a section for issue reporting or first contributions

Expected output:
A clear and welcoming `CONTRIBUTING.md` that guides new developers, reduces friction in pull requests, and helps scale the project community.
