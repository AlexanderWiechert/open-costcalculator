# ðŸ›  Modularize main.py by resource type

We want to break up the logic in `main.py` and route processing for each resource to a modular `process_<service>()` function.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Implementation Plan

- Create `handlers/` or `resources/<service>/process.py`
- Move service-specific loops from `main.py` to these files
- `main.py` dispatches processing based on active analyzers

---

### ðŸ§ª Tests

- Ensure all analyzers are called correctly
- Validate CLI results remain the same

---

### ðŸ§± Notes

This makes the codebase more maintainable and readable.
