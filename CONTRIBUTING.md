## How to Contribute

### Bug Reports

Please include:
- A short description of the bug
- Reproduction steps (if possible, include Terraform plan snippet or command)
- Environment information (Python version, OS)

### Feature Requests

Describe the problem your feature solves and suggest a clear implementation direction if possible.

### Code Contributions

We welcome improvements to:
- New AWS resource analyzers
- CLI enhancements
- Output formatting
- Logging or configuration improvements

---

## Development Standards

- Follow [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) and use `black` and `isort` for formatting:
  ```bash
  black --line-length 120 src/ tests/
  isort src/ tests/
  ```

- Keep functions small and modular.

- Use logging over `print()` for all runtime messages:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.warning("Example warning message")
  ```

- Prefer clear naming over comments.

---

## Testing

We use `pytest`. Run tests with:
```bash
pytest
```

Add tests in the `tests/` directory. Cover new modules and logic with unit tests.

To check test coverage:
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

---

## Commit and GitHub Flow

- Use feature branches (`feature/xyz`, `bugfix/abc`)
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
    - `feat:` for new features
    - `fix:` for bug fixes
    - `docs:` for documentation only
    - `refactor:` for internal changes
- Example:
  ```
  feat(rds): add support for gp3 volumes
  ```

After opening a PR, please describe what your changes do and link any related issues.
